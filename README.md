# employee-pay-slip
Repo for Seisma coding test.

**Assumptions Made**
  - Payment dates always start at the beginning of the month and end on the last day of the month in the input file. The program should be able to manage different fields, but this assumption was made anyway.

**How To Run**
  - To run the program, run the **target/employee-pay-slip-1.jar** file from the command line using **java -jar employee-pay-slip-1.jar "input\file\location.csv"**.

Additional notes:
  - This project has been tested and run in Visual Studio Code using jdk-14
