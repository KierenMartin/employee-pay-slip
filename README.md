# employee-pay-slip
Repo for Seisma coding test.

**Assumptions Made**
  - Payment dates always start at the beginning of the month and end on the last day of the month in the input file. The program should be able to manage different fields, but this assumption was made anyway.

**How To Run**
  *These methods have only been tested in a Windows 10 environment*
  - To run the program, download the **target\employee-pay-slip-1.jar** file and run it from the command line using **java -jar employee-pay-slip-1.jar "input\file\location.csv"**.
  - Alternatively, you can run the **Run With Input File.bat** if you have downloaded the entire project repo.

Additional notes:
  - This project has been tested and run in Visual Studio Code using jdk-14
